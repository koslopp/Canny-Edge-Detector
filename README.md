# Canny-Edge-Detector
Simple interface for applying Canny Edge Detector in images with Matlab. Developed for the course SSGN-12006 – BASIC COURSE IN IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING at Tampere University of Technology (TUT).

The software was developed in MATLAB R2015b and consists in a GUI interface to apply the Canny Edge Detector. In the GUI, the user can select the image from “Select Figure” button and input parameters for “Lower Threshold”, “Higher Threshold” and “Sigma” in the corresponding fields. To select a specific region in the image where the edges should be detected, the user should first click in the left image area (original image), a cross pointer should appear and then region can be selected. To finally detect the edges, the user should press the button “Detect Edges”. If no specific region was selected, the software will detect edges in the whole image. The result is displayed in the right image.

- To start the program open the file "canny_edge_detec.m" in MATLAB and run it.
